# Objective: To practice creating a basic wireframe for a homepage of an e-commerce website.

## Instructions:

* Divide the audience into small groups (3-5 people per group).
* Provide each group with a blank sheet of paper or access to a digital wireframing tool.
* Present the following scenario to the groups: "You are tasked with designing the homepage for an e-commerce website that sells fashion accessories."
* Set a time limit of 15-20 minutes for the groups to create a wireframe of the homepage.
* Instruct the groups to consider the following elements in their wireframes:
* Layout: How will they structure the content on the page? Where will the logo, navigation, search bar, and featured products be placed?
* Typography: Which fonts and font sizes will they use for headings, subheadings, and body text?
* Color: What color scheme will they choose for the homepage? How will they use color to highlight important elements?
* Key Elements: What other essential elements should be included, such as a promotional banner, product categories, or a call-to-action button?
* After the time is up, ask each group to share their wireframe with the rest of the audience.
* Encourage a discussion where each group explains their design choices and receives feedback from the audience.
* Summarize the key takeaways from the exercise, highlighting different approaches and design considerations.
